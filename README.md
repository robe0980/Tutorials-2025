# COMP2030 & COMP9030 Tutorial Projects

During assigned times througout the semester, you will be asked to work through the tutorial discussion points using this project.  The early tutorials will guide you through the use of VS Code, GitHub, branching, committing, and pull requests, as well as introduce you to the CodeSpaces envirionment we will be working within. Later sessions will have you work through the creation of simple websites to practice your skills in preparation for the assignment tasks.  Each week, additional folders or assets will be provided through FLO for you to add to this project.  

It is expected that you will share your project with your group members or specific people.  This will be done through Collaborators in GitHub.

## Structure
The project space (repository) will contain individual folders within the `src` directory for each of the Tutorial sessions.
